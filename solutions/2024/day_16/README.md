# Day 16 (2024)

`Reindeer Maze` ([prompt](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/16))

Today's challenge involves navigating through a grid-based maze using a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Part 1
As usual we parse this 2D puzzle using the technique explained in [Day 6](../day_06/README.md). In the first part we need to find the minimum cost from `start` to `end` in this maze. Each step forward will be `1` cost unit and turning in any direction `1000`. To do this in the most efficient way, I decided to use the [Dijkstra Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) that you can see implemented here that will return the cost of the minimum path.

```py
def dijkstra(grid, start, end):
    distances = defaultdict(lambda:(float("inf")))
    dirs = [(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)]
    distances[start, 1] = 0
    queue = [(0, start, 1)]
    while queue:
        dist, pos, di = heapq.heappop(queue)
        for ndi in range(-1, 2):
            ndir = dirs[(di+ndi)%4]
            npos, ndist = add_points(pos, ndir), dist + 1 + 1000*(ndi!=0)
            if npos == end:
                return ndist
            if grid[npos] != "#":
                o_dist = distances[npos, (di+ndi)%4]
                if o_dist >= ndist:
                    distances[npos, (di+ndi)%4] = ndist
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (ndist, npos, (di+ndi)%4))

class Solution(StrSplitSolution):
    def part1(self) -> tuple[int, int]:
        grid = parse_grid(self.input)
        start = list(grid.keys())[list(grid.values()).index("S")]
        end = list(grid.keys())[list(grid.values()).index("E")]
        return dijkstra(grid, start, end)
```

## Part 2
In the second part, we need to calculate the number of distinct segments that are part of any of the possible paths with the minimum cost from `start` to `end`. Since multiple paths may share the same minimum cost but traverse different portions of the grid, we need to track the unique segments visited along these paths.

To adapt Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for this purpose, we track not only the distances but also the set of segments traversed for each position and direction. This is achieved by maintaining a record of all segments visited in a set `nset`.

```py
def dijkstra(grid: Grid, start: GridPoint, end: GridPoint) -> tuple[int, int]:
    distances = defaultdict(lambda: (float("inf"), set()))
    dirs = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    distances[start, 1] = (0, set())
    queue = [(0, start, 1)]
    while queue:
        dist, pos, di = heapq.heappop(queue)
        _, p_set = distances[pos, di]
        for ndi in range(-1, 2):
            ndir = dirs[(di + ndi) % 4]
            npos, ndist = add_points(pos, ndir), dist + 1 + 1000 * (ndi != 0)
            while (
                grid[npos] != "#"
                and grid[(npos[0] + ndir[1], npos[1] + ndir[0])] == "#"
                and grid[(npos[0] - ndir[1], npos[1] - ndir[0])] == "#"
            ):
                npos, ndist = add_points(npos, ndir), ndist + 1
            nset = p_set | {seg(pos, npos)}
            if npos == end:
                return ndist, countsegs(nset)
            if grid[npos] != "#":
                o_dist, o_set = distances[npos, (di + ndi) % 4]
                if o_dist == ndist and any((pos not in o_set) for pos in nset):
                    o_set.update(nset)
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (ndist, npos, (di + ndi) % 4))
                if o_dist > ndist:
                    distances[npos, (di + ndi) % 4] = ndist, nset
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (ndist, npos, (di + ndi) % 4))
```

Once we have the set of all segments traversed in the optimal paths, we count the number of unique segments using the helper function `countsegs`. This function calculates the total number of unique line segments, ensuring that overlapping segments are not double-counted.

```py
def countsegs(segset: set) -> int:
    ret, points = 0, set()
    for a, b, c, d in segset:
        ret += abs(a - c) + abs(b - d) + 1 - ((a, b) in points) - ((c, d) in points)
        points.update({(a, b), (c, d)})
    return ret
```

Finally, we combine both parts that return the output of the Dijkstra function that gives us the correct answer directly:
```py
class Solution(StrSplitSolution):
    def solve(self) -> tuple[int, int]:
        grid = parse_grid(self.input)
        start = list(grid.keys())[list(grid.values()).index("S")]
        end = list(grid.keys())[list(grid.values()).index("E")]
        return dijkstra(grid, start, end)
```
