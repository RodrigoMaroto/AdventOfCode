# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo contains my solutions in Python to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems starting in 2024 (and hopefully continuing in the future...). I have completed some problems over the past 3-4 years but never managed to fill the whole calendar.  

For those unfamiliar with Advent of Code, it is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. Mr. [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) has been doing this since 2015 and I feel it is only right to thank him and credit him for his amazing work. 
  
In order to make this a more interesting, motivating and learning experience I will also write a small explanation each day of the solution that will force me to rethink and try to optimize some of my solutions (because no one likes to write about some spaghetti and inneficient code).

## Template attribution
Both the template and the inspiration for the write-ups of each problem come from David (xavdid) and you can find all of his amazing work on his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/) and his [blog](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id/)
